# Multi-Armed Bandit Reinforcement Learning Project
## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and comparing three different algorithms for solving the Multi-Armed Bandit problem. The goal is to determine the most optimal advertisement type out of ten available options (Ad1 to Ad10). The algorithms weâ€™ll compare are:

- Algoritma A/B Testing: A classic approach where we randomly assign users to different ads and measure their performance.
- Epsilon Greedy: An exploration-exploitation strategy that balances between trying new ads (exploration) and exploiting the best-performing ad (exploitation).
- Adaptive Epsilon Greedy: Similar to Epsilon Greedy, but with a dynamically adjusted exploration rate.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Explore the data in Ads_CTR_Optimisation.csv to understand the ad performance metrics.
Run the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to analyze the data and compare the algorithms.
## Usage
Modify the parameters (e.g., epsilon, l,f, number of iteration/loop) in Jupyter File.ipynb as needed.
Run the bandit algorithms using the provided data.
Evaluate the performance of each algorithm using relevant metrics (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate).
## Determining Optimal Ad Type
To evaluate the performance of each algorithm, consider the following metrics:

1. Total Click-Through Rate (CTR):
    - Calculate the total CTR for each ad type over multiple iterations.
    - Choose the ad type with the highest total CTR as the most optimal.
2. Regret:
   - Regret measures how much potential reward is lost by not selecting the best-performing ad at each step.
   - Minimize regret by selecting the ad type that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.
## Results
After conducting experiments and analyzing the performance of different algorithms, we observed the following:

1. Adaptive Epsilon Greedy:
   * This algorithm adapts its exploration rate dynamically based on the observed rewards. It aims to strike a balance between exploration (trying out different ads) and exploitation (choosing the best-performing ad).
   * Optimal Ad Type: The adaptive epsilon greedy algorithm identified the most optimal ad type with a high degree of confidence.
   * Complexity: However, it is worth noting that the adaptive epsilon greedy algorithm is more complex to implement and tune compared to other methods.
2. Algoritma A/B Testing:
   * A classic approach where users are randomly assigned to different ads, and their performance is measured.
   * Optimal Ad Type: While A/B testing provides a straightforward way to compare ads, it may not always identify the optimal ad type with high certainty.
   * Simplicity: A/B testing is simpler to set up and understand, making it a good choice for scenarios where complexity is a concern.
3. Epsilon Greedy:
   * This algorithm balances exploration and exploitation by randomly selecting an ad with a certain probability (epsilon) and choosing the best-performing ad otherwise.
   * Optimal Ad Type: Epsilon Greedy falls between the other two algorithms in terms of both performance and complexity.
   *  Intermediate Difficulty: It offers a moderate level of complexity, making it a suitable choice for scenarios where a balance between simplicity and sophistication is desired.
In summary, if you prefer a simpler approach and are willing to accept some uncertainty, A/B testing is a suitable choice. However, if you want a more sophisticated solution that adapts over time, Adaptive Epsilon Greedy is the way to go.

Remember to adjust the parameters and evaluate the algorithms based on relevant metrics.
> [!TIP] 
> While all algorithms consistently identified Ad5 as the optimal ad type, itâ€™s essential to consider the impact of randomness. Since the algorithms operate based on random exploration, we recommend running them for a large number of iterations (e.g., 500 iterations) and then averaging the results. By doing so, we can reduce the influence of occasional variations due to randomness.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In some cases, the algorithms may yield slightly different results (e.g., identifying Ad8 as optimal a few times), but these differences are not statistically significant (occurring less than 5 times). Therefore, we can confidently eliminate such outliers.
